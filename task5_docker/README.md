# Docker

**Current status: in progress...**

## Task description

### Build a docker container for your python app

- this time it needs to listen port 8080, HTTP only
- the lighter in terms of image size it is - the most points you get
- the one who builds the smallest image gets even more points!

### Hints

- use the minimal possible setup
- 100Mb is a lot ;-)
