### 2021-07-12

Watch lecture topic about working experience in Andersen. Learn about differences between CI, CD and CD:
**Continuous integration** means making new releases as often as possible (merging changes to main branch). The developer's changes are validated by creating a build and running automated tests against the build. By doing so, you avoid integration challenges that can happen when waiting for release day to merge changes into the release branch. Continuous integration puts a great emphasis on testing automation to check that the application is not broken whenever new commits are integrated into the main branch.
**Continuous delivery** is an extension of _continuous integration_ since it automatically deploys all code changes to a testing and/or production environment after the build stage. This means that on top of automated testing, you have an automated release process and you can deploy your application any time by clicking a button.
**Continuous deployment** goes one step further than _continuous delivery_. With this practice, every change that passes all stages of your production pipeline is released to your customers. There's no human intervention, and only a failed test will prevent a new change to be deployed to production.
